# FireworksDisplay
Created a working fireworks display animation using processing

How to use the code?

Preferred Method:
Method 1: 
- Create a new sketch file on processing and paste the content from the three files (main, explosion, particle)
  into the sketch file one by one. 
- Next download all the pictures and update the code in the main file that imports the images - to access the file location right click on image, then go to properties and copy     paste the location (starts with C://....)

Method 2:
Clone the repository and upload the code onto processing, and then update the image/sound import codes
